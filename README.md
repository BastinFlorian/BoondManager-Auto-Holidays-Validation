# BoondManager-Auto-Holidays-Validation

This repository allows you to automate the holidays request from your employees having :<br />

- 2.08 CP per month <br /> 
- 0.58 RTT per month <br /> 

It can be used by the human ressources of any company generating its payslip from BoondManager. <br />
This repository contains an executable button, such that any human ressources employee can use it once it is downloaded. <br />
It produces a google drive spreadhsheet with one worksheet per employee with the details of the computations and allows the human ressources to accelerate their process of holiday requests. <br />
